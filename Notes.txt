- The metamodel handles only block structured models: 
	- Every split gateway must have a corresponding merge gateway
	- Every flownode that is not a gateway have exactly one incoming control flow and one outgoing control flow

- The model does not handle loops: since an activity cannot have more than one inflow, 
there is not way to model loops. 

- Assumed that input and output names are well formed: each name is unique, each output name is unique and if
an output name exists also as an input, they reference the same data object.
